Project Description: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) PDF Application

Project Overview:
The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) PDF Application is designed to enhance document processing capabilities by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract and retrieve relevant information from PDF documents. This project integrates multiple Python libraries to create a robust system capable of processing, embedding, and querying PDF content efficiently.

Key Features:

	•	Document Processing: Convert and preprocess PDF documents for further analysis.
	•	Embedding Generation: Utilize state-of-the-art embeddings to represent document content in a format suitable for retrieval and analysis.
	•	Query Handling: Implement RAG to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to user queries based on the document content.
